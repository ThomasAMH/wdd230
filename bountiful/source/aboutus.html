        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <h3>From our Family to Yours</h3>
        <p>Our journey began in 2005, when I was in my kitchen with my kids. "Dad, make me a smoothie!" I obliged them, and after seeing their joyful faces, I thought, "are these really so tasty?"
            I called my wife over, and she took a sip. "This is phenominal! What's in it?" She asked. The answer I gave then is the answer I still give today: "Fresh and natural fruits, wholesome veggies, and lots of love!"
            I had always wanted to start a restaurant, and after I got that support from my family, I was ready to dive in!

        <h2>Bountiful Flagship Store - The Grove</h2>
        <p>
            Before the food truck mania caught on in the later 2000's, thanks to the help of some very kind investors (who were won over by my fresh smoothies), we were able to open our first location inside The Grove.
            We've been open there for years, serving up goodness with a smile, but we wanted to expand our influence, and take our show on the road, as it were. Our store is still open today (and you'll catch me working a shift there from time to time), but we started to share Earth's bounty when we opened...
        </p>
        <h2>Bounty on Wheels - The Foodtruck Fleet</h2>
        <p>
            My buddy Mitch approached me with the crazy idea to buy a food truck, then drive around selling smoothies.
            I told him I wasn't so sure, but he told me that if the idea failed, he'd buy the truck off of me; if the idea went well, however, I owed him free smoothies for life.
            We went from one food truck to over 50, and the rest, as they say, is history.
